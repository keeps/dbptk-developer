{"name":"Db-preservation-toolkit","tagline":"Database Preservation Toolkit","body":"Database Preservation Toolkit\r\n=============================\r\n\r\nThe Database Preservation Toolkit allows conversion between Database formats, including connection to live systems, for purposes of digitally preserving databases. The toolkit allows conversion of live or backed-up databases into preservation formats such as DBML, an XML format created for the purpose of database preservation. The toolkit also allows conversion of the preservation formats back into live systems to allow the full functionality of databases. For example, it supports a specialized export into MySQL, optimized for PhpMyAdmin, so the database can be fully  experimented using a web interface.\r\n\r\nThis toolkit was part of the [RODA project](http://www.roda-community.org) and now has been released as a project by its own due to the increasing interest on this particular feature. \r\n\r\nThe toolkit is created as a platform that uses input and output modules. Each module supports read and/or write to a particular database format or live system. New modules can easily be added by implementation of a new interface and adding of new drivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to build from source\r\n\r\n1. Download the [latest stable release](https://github.com/keeps/db-preservation-toolkit/releases).\r\n2. Unzip and open the folder on a command-line terminal\r\n3. Build with Maven\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ mvn clean package\r\n```\r\n\r\nBinaries will be on the `target` folder\r\n\r\n## Download pre-compiled version\r\n\r\nBinaries with all dependencies included:\r\n* [db-preservation-toolkit-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar](http://keeps.github.io/db-preservation-toolkit/db-preservation-toolkit-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar)\r\n\r\n## How to use\r\n\r\nTo use the program, open a command-line and try out the following command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ java -jar db-preservation-toolkit-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar \r\nSynopsys: java -jar roda-common-convert-db.jar -i IMPORT_MODULE [options...] -o EXPORT_MODULE [options...]\r\nAvailable import modules:\r\n\tSQLServerJDBC serverName [port|instance] database username password useIntegratedSecurity encrypt\r\n\tPostgreSQLJDBC hostName database [port] username password encrypt\r\n\tMySQLJDBC hostName [port] database username password\r\n\tOracle8i hostName port database username password <- untested!\r\n\tMSAccess database.mdb\r\n\tODBC source [username password]\r\n\tDBML baseDir\r\nAvailable export modules:\r\n\tSQLServerJDBC serverName [port|instance] database username password useIntegratedSecurity encrypt\r\n\tPostgreSQLJDBC hostName database [port] username password encrypt\r\n\tMySQLJDBC hostName [port] database username password\r\n\tPhpMyAdmin hostName [port] database username password\r\n\tDBML baseDir\r\n\tPostgreSQLFile sqlFile <- SQL file optimized for PostgreSQL\r\n\tMySQLFile sqlFile <- SQL file optimized for MySQL\r\n\tSQLServerFile sqlFile <- SQL file optimized for SQL Server\r\n\tGenericSQLFile sqlFile <- generic SQL file\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou have to select an input and an output module, providing for each its configuration.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, if you want to connect to a live MySQL database and export its content to DBML format, you can use the following command.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ java -jar db-preservation-toolkit-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar \\\r\n-i MySQLJDBC localhost example_db username p4ssw0rd \\\r\n-o DBML example_db_dbml_export\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Related publications & presentations\r\n\r\n* Presentation [\"Database migration: CLI\"](http://hdl.handle.net/1822/17856) by José Ramalho at \"A Pratical Approach to Database Archiving\", Danish National Archives, Copenhagen, Denmark, 2012-02-07.\r\n* Presentation [\"RODA: a service-oriented digital repository: database archiving\"](http://hdl.handle.net/1822/17860) by José Ramalho at \"A Pratical Approach to Database Archiving\", Danish National Archives, Copenhagen, Denmark, 2012-02-07.\r\n* Presentation [\"RODA - Repository of Authentic Digital Objects\"](http://hdl.handle.net/1822/7405) by Luis Faria at the International Workshop on Database Preservation, Edinburgh, 2007.\r\n* José Carlos Ramalho, [Relational database preservation through XML modelling](http://hdl.handle.net/1822/7120), in proceedings of the International Workshop on Markup of Overlapping Structures (Extreme Markup 2007), Montréal, Canada, 2007.\r\n* Marta Jacinto, [Bidirectional conversion between XML documents and relational data bases](http://hdl.handle.net/1822/601), in proceedings of the International Conference on CSCW in Design, Rio de Janeiro, 2002.\r\n* Ricardo Freitas, [Significant properties in the preservation of relational databases](http://hdl.handle.net/1822/13702), Springer, 2010.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther related publications:\r\n* Neal Fitzgerald, \"Using data archiving tools to preserve archival records in business systems – a case study\", in proocedings of iPRES 2013, Lisbon, 2013.\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting\r\n\r\n**Getting exception \"java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused\"**\r\n\r\nMost databases are not configured by default to allow TCP/IP connections. Check your database configuration if it accepts TCP/IP connection and if your IP address is allowed to connect. Also, ensure that the user has permissions to access the database from the your IP address.\r\n\r\n**Problems importing from Microsoft Access**\r\n\r\nIn order to extract DB structures we need to have access to the internal DB table Msysrelationships. We need to perform some hacking over the DBMS and this is version dependent. Microsoft published a white paper explaining how to do this for all versions: [\"Preparing a Microsoft Access Database for Migration\"](https://redmine.keep.pt/attachments/download/2885).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Information & Commercial support\r\n\r\nFor more information or commercial support, contact [KEEP SOLUTIONS](http://www.keep.pt/contactos/?lang=en).\r\n","google":"UA-42276300-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
